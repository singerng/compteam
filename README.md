A collection of lectures for the Montgomery Blair High School Computer Team for the 2017-18 school year.

The lectures are divided into four main subject areas:
* Computer systems
* Theory of computation
* Machine learning+
* Algorithms and competition programming

I (Noah Singer) am the principal author of the content, as well as the Captain of Computer Team for the 2016-17 and 2017-18 school years. I have written these lectures along with Arman Siddique, George Klees, Andrew Komo, and other members of the MBHS Computer Team.
